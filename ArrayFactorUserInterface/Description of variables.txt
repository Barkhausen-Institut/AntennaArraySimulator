This is brief introduction about the description of variables,which are required for AF calculations, used in this user interface. 
For thorough information, please check the 'Theory of Array Factor.pdf'.

VARIABLES:

1) b: The coefficient represents the association of distance and wavelength. (d=bλ)) 
	Accordingly, 
		    1.1) bx:The coefficient represents the association of distance between elements along x axis and wavelength 
		    1.2) by:The coefficient represents the association of distance between elements along y axis and wavelength 
		    1.3) bz:The coefficient represents the association of distance between elements along z axis and wavelength 
		    
		    	 Note: 	For the non-uniformly spaced elements along the axis, b varies with respect to the increase rate.
			        For the uniformly spaced elements along the axis, b is constant for the distance between entire elements. 


2) Frequency of electromagnetic signal (f): Frequency of the signal sent. It must be written in GHz. 
3) Center Frequency (f0): Carrier frequency. It must be written in GHz. 
4) Steering angle: It is the desired steering angle. It must be written in degree.
5) Nx: Total number of elements along x axis
6) Ny: Total number of elements along y axis
7) Nz: Total number of elements along z axis
8) increaserate: This is the amount of change of distances between the elements in the case of NON-UNIFORM spacing.



Note: Default values in the user interface are arranged for an uniformly spaced array along y axis with d=0.5λ and N=8,16,32 respectively.
